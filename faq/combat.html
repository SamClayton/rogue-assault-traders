<P>This section gives a rough explanation of how the combat 
system in <STRONG>Alien Assault Traders 0.20</STRONG> and up works. If you are 
familier with how combat works in <STRONG>BNT</STRONG> and <STRONG>NGS</STRONG>             
               
   games then stop right there and throw it out the window.</P>
<P>Our new combat system is based around how board based 
strategy games work.&nbsp; Each item in the game is assigned a number of hit 
points.&nbsp; This is how much damage an item can take before it is destroyed.&nbsp; Items used for attacking 
are assigned damage points.&nbsp; This is the maximum amount of damage an item can 
inflict on something.&nbsp; Attacking items do not inflict their maximum damage.&nbsp; The amount of damage 
they inflict is based upon many factors from the difference in tech 
levels to jammers and ecm levels.</P>
<P><STRONG>Here is an example.</STRONG>   </P>
<P>1 Unit of armor can take 1500 points of damage before it is destroyed. </P>
<P>1&nbsp;Torpedo can inflict a maximum of 2500 points of damage.</P>
<P>If the torpedo gets a perfect roll for damage it could wipe out over 1 unit 
of armor but this is usually not the case.&nbsp; You may only do 1000 points of 
damage.&nbsp; The amount depends upon some of the differences mentioned 
above.</P>
<P>The difference between a players sensor tech and the 
other players ecm tech for ship to ship and planet to ship combat determines the 
damage percentage range.&nbsp; This is the percentage range to determine how 
much damage each attack unit can inflict.&nbsp; If the range is 50% to 100% then 
a torpedo could do from 1250 to 2500 points of damage.&nbsp; The range varies 
depending upon ecm/sensor differences and it slides up and down the 
scale.&nbsp; You could have damage percentage ranges like 30% to 56%.</P>
<P>Also, the higher your tech level for offensive weapons the more unreliable 
they can become.&nbsp; This means they may not function at maximum 
efficiency.&nbsp; A percentage of your torpedo launchers may malfunction, your 
beams may have lowered output.&nbsp; And there is a very rare chance that they 
may fail completely.&nbsp; Even though there is a higher failure rate for higher 
tech levels you still get far, far&nbsp;more damage output than lower tech 
levels.</P>
<P>There is also a confusion factor that comes into play when you have tech 
levels that are very far apart.&nbsp; If you have level 25 fighter bays and 
attacking a ship with level 5 fighter bays then alot of your fighters are going 
to get confused as to who the targets are because there are so many friendlies 
crowding their displays.&nbsp; So most of your fighters may not even find an 
enemy fighter to attack.&nbsp; Some of the enemy fighters may actually 
escape.</P>
<P>If your ship or planet takes ANY armor damage then they may take internal 
damage to their tech levels.&nbsp; If a ship/planet loses 50% of their armor 
then they can have internal damage on upto 5 different tech levels.&nbsp; This 
doesn't mean you WILL take damage to 5 tech levels.&nbsp; You may take damage to 
1 or 2 or maybe none.&nbsp; It is a random factor as to how many of the 5 you 
will take damage.&nbsp; If you lose 99% of your armor you could take damage to 
ALL of your tech levels.</P>
<P>Once a tech level takes damage the amount of damage to that tech level is 
also based upon the amount of armor lost.&nbsp; If 50% of the armor was lost 
then the damaged tech level can take from 1% to 50% damage to the tech 
level.&nbsp; If the tech level started at 20 then the tech level can be damaged 
from 0 to 10 tech levels.&nbsp; So it may end up showing the damaged tech level 
as 10-20 on your reports.&nbsp; When your tech levels are damaged your ship will 
only operate at those damaged tech levels in any further combat.&nbsp; You must 
go to a Spacedock to have your ship levels repaired or use the repair option on 
the planet screen for planets.&nbsp; Repairing tech level damage only costs a 
fraction of a normal level upgrade.</P>
<P>In the Ship vs Ship, Ship vs Planet and Sector D catagories we will go into a 
little more detail on specifics for those different combat modes.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sector Ownership and Bounties</STRONG></P>
<P>Owning a sector is critical if you want to protect yourself from smaller 
players.&nbsp; If you would like to be able to attack small players planets or 
ships you need to own more than half of the <STRONG>based</STRONG> planets a 
sector can support.</P>
<P>Sector supports 5 planets you must own 3<BR>Sector supports 4 planets you 
must own 3<BR>Sector supports 3 planets you must own 2<BR>Sector supports 2 
planets you must own 2<BR>Sector supports 1 planet you must own 1</P>
<P>Remember the planets you own must be <STRONG>based</STRONG>.&nbsp; If you own 
the number of based planets needed for the sector then you can attack 
<STRONG>any</STRONG> player who is in that sector and never get a bounty.&nbsp; 
As long as you own it then it is a bounty free area and any planet or player in 
the sector is fair game to attack.</P>
<P><STRONG>Federation Bounties</STRONG></P>
<P>Federation bounties are given to players who attack other players who are 
alot smaller than they are.&nbsp; When you scan a ship, planet or sector you 
will be told if you will receive a bounty by attacking the player or 
planet.&nbsp; You can also get a bounty if you try to place spies on a planet 
you would get a bounty from by attacking.&nbsp; The only attack that is bounty 
free are sector defenses.&nbsp; Anyone can attack sector defenses without 
getting a bounty.</P>
<P>If you have a Federation Bounty placed on you then you can be attacked by 
anyone.&nbsp; This means if you are a medium sized player&nbsp; and get a 
federation bounty then even the highest ranked player can attack you and not get 
a bounty.&nbsp; You are also locked out of normal&nbsp;repair, upgrade and 
device ports.&nbsp; You can access Kabal owned upgrade and device ports but the 
prices you pay are 10 times or more than normal. If you receive 3 or more 
Federation bounties then the Federation Battle Cruiser will attack your ship 
once a day.&nbsp; The cost of the damage inflicted upon your ship will be 
deducted from the Federation bounties you owe.&nbsp; The big downside to this is 
you cannot repair your ship or even change ships as you are locked out of all 
shipyards until the bounty is payed off.</P>
<P><STRONG>Federation Bounties and Teams</STRONG></P>
<P>Federation bounties are slightly different if you are on a team.&nbsp; There 
is nothing different when you are attacking other players.&nbsp; The difference 
is when other players are attacking you.</P>
<P>When your ship/planets are attacked by other players and you are on a team, 
the attack nolonger uses your player ranking for calculating Federation 
bounties.&nbsp; The ranking of the <STRONG>top player</STRONG> on your team is 
used for everyone on that team.&nbsp; This means that if a top ranked player can 
attack the top ranked player on your team then they can also attack the 
<STRONG>lowest</STRONG> ranked player on your team and never get a bounty.&nbsp; 
Your team will have to work together to protect each other.&nbsp; The top ranked 
player on your team will have to help the lower ranked players get bigger and 
provide defenses.&nbsp; The lower ranked players on the team will have to hide 
in the top ranked players sectors.&nbsp; The team will actually have to work 
together or the lowest ranked players on the team will get picked off by 
others.</P>
