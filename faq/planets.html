Planets is the key to making lots of credits in the game.  When you first start out trading is king but as you build your planets they can work while you sleep and do not cost you turns to make you a profit.  
<p>
You can get a planet three ways.  Capture an unowned one, create one with a genesis device or attack someone else's planet.  My suggestion is starting out is to capture an unowned one or create your own.  Another big hint is build your planet near or in an upgrade port.  Once you start filling with colonists you will see the closer the upgrade port the better.  If you have built in an upgrade port your turn cost for moving colonists onto your new planet is 2 turns, shouldn't it be every where else, even the closest sectors will cost you at least 4 turns to move colonists so you will find good upgrade ports are a premium sector to build your empire in.

<p>
<b>Name Planet</b> - This allows you to name your planet.  This is handy when tracking which planet is making you the best production and if you happen to get an embezzler.<p>
<b>Build Base</b> - This is the first thing you will need when you create or capture a planet.  You will need to transfer 10,000 goods, ore and organics to the planet.  Cost is 10 million credits for a base so you will need to transfer that as well.  You can also let your colonists produce the goods, ore and organics, but that will take longer<p>

<b>Transfer</b> - The transfer menu is how you load and off load cargo to your planet.  It is also the place you transfer credits, energy, fighters, torps, spies and dignitaries to the planet.  <p>

<b>Upgrade</b> - The upgrade menu is very similar to the ship upgrade menu.  Each item you upgrade is highlighted below so you know its true use.<br>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fighter Bay</strong> - 
  This controls how many fighters the planet can send in the defence of the 
  planet at a time. Even though the planet may have million fighters it can only 
  support so many fighters in the air at a time. This level controls that 
  number, the higher the number the more fighters can be used at a time when 
  your planet is being attacked. It is also used as a defensive computer 
  controlling how fast your sector fighters can attack a player that is using 
  attack and run offense.<p></p>
	<li><strong>Beams</strong> - This 
  weapon will go after your attackers shields if the shields are breached then a 
  small part of beams will go against the attackers armor. A small part of beams 
  will hit incoming fighters and torps as well.<p></p>
	<li><strong>Torpedo Launchers</strong> 
  - This is what will kill your attacker as torps are deadly against shields. If 
  your beams have breached the shields then the torps will go directly against 
  the armor, if not they will go against the attackers shields.<p></p>
	<li><strong>Sensors</strong> - are 
  used to detect any incoming attackers trying to cloak into the sector. If your 
  sensors detect that player your fighters and torps will attack that player. 
  Sensors will also help detect spies when someone is trying to sneak them to 
  your planet.<p></p>
	<li><strong>Cloak</strong> - effect 
  how a potential attacker can see your planet or not. It also makes it harder 
  for anyone to scan and see the values. Cloaking may also cloak sector defence 
  so someone scanning the sector may not see any fighters or mines at all<p></p>
	<li><strong>Jammers</strong> - will 
  Jam enemy sensors causing them to misread both high and low at times. It will 
  also effect what anyone scanning the sector sees as well so sector defence may 
  look bigger or smaller than it really is.<p></p>
	<li><strong>Shields</strong> - Shields 
  protect your armor. If your shields and energy on the planets levels are high 
  enough the attacker may have to beat your planet to death and not get 
  anywhere. Shields are very important in protecting your planet from taking 
  damage. Once your shields are breached beware. Planets require 10 times the 
  energy to power their shields compared to a ship of the same tech level.<p></p>
	<li><strong>Armour</strong> - Keeps 
  your planet from being taken. Once armor is breached, your planet is captured. 
  When your armor is hit allot it will cause overall tech damage to the planet. 
  The more armor damage is done the more tech damage a planet may take. Armor is 
  generated based on your avg overall tech level for the planet and you need a 
  minimal of 10K Goods and Ore to Generate armor. If those levels drop off your 
  armor will degenerate, so make sure you have enough production levels to 
  maintain or build armor.<p></p>                                                                                                 </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Repair</b> - Once your armor is damaged and you try to upgrade you will notice a repair over certain levels.  You will need to repair the damage done before you upgrade.  Planets not repaired will operate at the damaged level instead of full strength.  Always make sure you repair any damage or the next attack you may very well lose the planer.<p>

<b>Destroy Planet</b> - Sometimes if your an attacker and you took a planet you can't afford to keep it or to defend it, so you take a pirate mentality and take anything off the planet you wanted and then destroy it.  You must have a genesis device in order to destroy a planet.<p>

<b>Production Percentages</b> - are the percentages of colonists that will do a particular job.  Some jobs will require more percentages of the population to maintain the levels of commodities you need to keep your planet safe and healthy
<p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fighters</strong> - 
  Control how many colonists are building fighters to store on your planet.<p></p>
<li><strong>Fighters</strong> - 
  Control how many colonists are building fighters to store on your planet.<p></p>
<li><strong>Torpedoes</strong> - 
  Control how many colonists are building torpedoes to store on your planet.<p></p>
<li><strong>Energy</strong> - Control 
  how many colonists are building energy to store on your planet. Note: Energy 
  support planetary beams, shields and any sector fighters you have in the air. 
  So don't forget to have a decent energy percentage or you may make your planet 
  vulnerable to attack or reduce the amount of fighters that your sector can 
  support.<p></p>
<li><strong>Goods</strong> - Control 
  how many colonists are building Goods to store on your planet. Goods are also 
  used to build armor points.<p></p>
<li><strong>Ore</strong> - Control how 
  many colonists are building Ore to store on your planet. Ore are also used to 
  build armor points.<p></p>
<li><strong>Organics</strong> - 
  Control how many colonists are building Organics to store on your planet. 
  Organics are needed to feed your population so be sure you have enough 
  organics being generated or your colonists will start to die off.<p></p>
<li><strong>Research</strong> - Control how many colonists are doing research for new technologies.  <strong>Note: This is for future versions of the game and we have just included it now so we do not have to make any changes in the future.</strong><p></p>
<li><strong>Build</strong> - Control how many colonists are building a research item you have completed.  <strong>Note: This is for future versions of the game and we have just included it now so we do not have to make any changes in the future.</strong><p></p>
<li><strong>Credits</strong> - This 
  percentage shows how many colonists are working toward credit production.<p></p>            </li>
</ul>
<P></P>
<p>
<b>Max Credits</b> - This is the maximum credits you can store on the planet.  Note:  The closer to max credits a planet is the higher the credit production.  So be sure to keep your planets close to max to get the credit production bonuses.<p>


<b>Spies</b> - By putting spies on 
your planet it helps you in two ways. First spies on your planet will help hunt 
any dignitary that has decided to steal from you. Then if your planet is 
captured and player didn't clean the planet of spies the spies will try to do 
the following: 
<UL><li><strong>Sneak to Ship</strong> 
  will report planets that player has visited. Also will tell you what sector 
  that player is in if they are online and what type and level and resources the 
  ship has. Also if it can infiltrate a different planet depending on the spy 
  settings.<p></p>
<li><strong>Saboteur</strong> - Will 
  destroy fighters and torps and effect production on the planet<p></p>
<li><strong>Steal Credits</strong> - 
  Will steal credits from the planet<p></p>
<li><strong>Steal Interest</strong> - 
  Will steal a small percentage of what the planet is making in credit 
production<p></p>
<li><strong>Birthrate decreaser</strong> - Will cause the planets birthrate to slow so it is not 
  producing any more colonists<p></p>
<li><strong>Capture Planet</strong> - This is extremely rare but will enable the spy to capture the planet</li></UL>
<P>One this to remember about spies that were on a planet that was 
captured.&nbsp; They will retain the cloaking value of the planet when it was 
captures.&nbsp; This cloaking value is what is used when the owner of the planet 
tries to clean spies off it.&nbsp; You can also try to place spies on an enemy 
planet.&nbsp; The cloak value of the spy you place on the planet is the value of 
the cloak tech of the ship that placed the spy on the planet.&nbsp; The spies 
cloak value will not change when you upgrade the ships cloak or change 
ships.&nbsp; The only way to change the cloak value of a spy you placed on an 
enemy planet is to go back to the planet, retrieve the spy with a ship that has 
a HIGHER cloak tech and then place the spy back on the planet.</P><p>
 <p>
<b>Dignitaries</b> - You can place dignitaries on your planet and they will enhance the planets performance by doing specific jobs.  The Jobs are as follows:<p>
<ul><li><strong>Birthrate Increaser</strong> - Increase colonists birthrates. 
  <p></p>
<li><strong>Birthrate Decreaser</strong> - Decreased colonist birthrates. This is handy as once your 
  planet reaches its colonist max the risk of revolt is very high. 
  <p></p>
<li><strong>Production Builders</strong> - increases planet production. 
  <p></p>
<li><strong>Credit Booster</strong> - 
  increases the amount of credits colonists can produce. 
  <p></p>         </li>
</ul>
Note:  Any dignitary may become an embezzler initially so you will have to keep a close eye on them, but once they have a real job, then you won't have to worry about them again.


<p>
<b>Armor Points</b> - These are not automatic and have to be generated.  To generate armor you must have maintain a minimal of 10,000 ore and goods.  Once that level is reached you will generated armor points based on your overall tech level of the planet.<p>


<b>Purchase/Upgrade Cargo Ship</b> - Once your planet has built up a nice supply of commodities you may want to sell them.  You can either haul them yourself or you can buy a cargo ship for the planet.  Cargo ships work by picking up the commodities off your planet and trading them with the ports you set up in the auto trade menu.<p>
<b>Auto Trade</b> - is where you set the ports you want to trade your commodities too.  Note:  The ports you enter must be a port that is BUYING that commodity.  You can't sell goods at goods ports or ore ports to ore ports.  However you can sell goods to ore ports and ore to goods ports.  Auto trades will only trade extra commodities over the 10,000 unit threshold.  Auto trades do not happen automatically they will happen several times throughout the day depending on server settings.<p>

<b>Clean for Spies</b> - This allows you to try to clean your planet for spies.  if you see someone has tried to send spies to your planet in your logs, its time to do a cleaning.  Also when you capture a planet you might clean for spies as well, there is nothing that sucks more than if you get a spy on your ship<p>

<b>Team Cash</b> - If the server allows it your team mates can take cash from your planet or put cash on the planet.  It will appear in your logs and the team coordinators logs when this happens so be sure you can trust your teammates.  Also you can toggle this option off on a planet by planet basis<p>

<b>Landing on the planet</b> - Once you build your planet it becomes your safety zone.  You can land on the planet and hide.  Keeps your ship out of the sector so other players won't know what you have exactly if they happen to wander into your sector.  Landing on your planet actually helps in your planet defence as well.  Your fighters and torps on your ship will join with the planets to help in your defence when attacked.  Also if you are landed on the planet your population will not declare independence.<p>

<b>Planetary Independence</b> - Planets have a chance of going independent approx every 24-36 hours.  Planets that are unbased will go independent the most often, however there is also a chance with low tech level planets.  The higher the overall planet tech level, the less likely they will go independent.  Any planets that do go independent will use the resources to put out its own sector defence and upgrade its own defences to prevent you from taking it back.<p>

<b>Planetary Disasters</b> - Currently these happen once a planet reaches about 90% of the max colonists that a planet can hold.  Currently a planet will hold 100 mill colonists + 5 mill extra for every avg tech level, so max for a level 10 planet is 150 mill colonists.  
<ul>
	<li><strong>Space Plague</strong> - 
  will kill a percentage of all your colonists.<p></p>
	<li><strong>Plasma Storm</strong> - 
  will cause a percentage of all your energy to dissipate<p></p>
	<li><strong>Planet Revolt</strong> - 
  This is the most evil of all the disasters. as when a planet revolts it loses 
  anywhere from 0-99% of everything on the planet.<p>
In the future there will be many more disaster 
  possibilities. So keep your eyes peeled.</p>                          </li>
