<P><STRONG><EM>The following hasn't been implimented yet and 
will be released as a patch.</EM></STRONG>             
                 
        </P>
<P>Sector Mines will attack based upon the ship class plus the hull size.&nbsp; 
Each ship class has it's own base hull size that will be added to the hull size 
you purchase or that comes default with the ship.</P>
<P>When your ship enters a sector with mines the combined size of your ship 
class basehull and hull tech size will determine the percentage of mines it 
attracts.</P>
<P>When the mines are attracted to the ship your ship will automatically send 
out any mine deflectors you have.&nbsp; All of your mine deflectors are sent out 
and they all attack the incoming mines.&nbsp; If any mine deflectors are left 
over after the attack your ship automatically retrieves them.</P>
<P>If the mines that were attracted by your ship are not all 
destroyed by the mine deflectors they will start impacting upon your ships 
armor.&nbsp; There is ALWAYS a chance mines will hit your armor no matter how many mine deflectors you are carrying.&nbsp; Mine deflectors nolonger take 
out one mine per one deflector.&nbsp; Mine deflectors can damage a mine 
upto 1.5 times the amount of damage a mine can absorb before being destroyed.&nbsp; So 
it is possible to destroy more mines than you have mine 
deflectors.</P>
<P>Mines are also cloaked by the highest planet cloak tech level.&nbsp; This 
makes it possible for your mine deflectors to completely miss incoming 
mines.&nbsp; So you need to have higher sensors to reduce the possibility of 
this happening.</P>
