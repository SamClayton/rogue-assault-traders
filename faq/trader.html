                        </font><STRONG>The 
Trader</STRONG> is the strategy 
                        most players begin with. <br>
                        <br>
                        You locate an Ore port and a Goods port in sectors next 
                        to each other. </span> Trade back and forth (using warp 
                        moves) until either you can afford a hull upgrade or the 
                        port's prices are no longer very good. Repeat often, and 
                        upgrade whenever you can. <br>
                        <br>
                          When you're engines are large enough to real 
                        space move (this varies on the galaxy size in each 
                        game, usually anywhere from 27-33) between two well stocked ports 
                        start trading using real space moves instead of warps. 
                        (Be sure to buy a Fuel Scoop before you real space trade.)<span lang="en-us"><br>

                        </span>Be sure to have the maximum amount of Emergency 
                        Warp Devices and an Escape Pod at all times to ensure 
                        survival. Focus on upgrading your Hull, Energy, and Engines. 
                        Everything else is good for combat or colonizing. Your 
                        military technologies can be zero as the Emergency Warp 
                        Devices are your primary means of survival<span lang="en-us">.</span>
                        <p> Trading allows for a quick rise in score, and allows 
                          players late to the game to catch up. However, the lack 
                          of planets virtually ensures that you will lose in the 
                          long run. <br>&nbsp;</p>
