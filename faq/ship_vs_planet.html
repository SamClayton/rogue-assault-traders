<p>The Ship to Planet combat is virtually the same as Ship to Ship so read that 
  FAQ if you haven't already.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the main differences.</p>
<p>The planet doesn't have an ECM tech level and the Jammer doesn't work like 
  the ECM. This means that a ship may be able to evade more of the planets defenses 
  while the planet can't avoid the ships attacks.</p>
<p>Planet shields use 10 times the energy of ship shields so they will go though 
  energy much faster when they are attacked.</p>
<p>Planets can store more energy, torpedoes and fighters than their tech levels 
  can use during an attack. So this means if you do not defeat the planet it will 
  rearm itself with energy, fighters and torps from storage.</p>
<p>If you destroy all of the planets shields and armor and you are destroyed then 
  the planet is not defeated.</p>
<p>Planets make their own armor and players need to adjust their production to 
  allow the building of armor. The armor tech level for a planet is the AVERAGE 
  of all the other tech levels on the planet. To build armor points to match the 
  tech level you must have more than 10,000 units of ore and goods on your planet. 
  The planet will slowly take ore and goods to build and maintain the armor. 
  If the stored ore and goods ever drops below 10,000 then the planets armor points 
  will start decreasing.</p>
<p>If a planet doesn't have any armor points then all an attacker has to do is 
  breach a planets shields to defeat it.</p>
<p>If there are any ships landed on the planet then they will also add their fighters, 
  beams and torpedoes to the number the planet is using. Landed ships will also 
  do this during sofa runs.</p>
<p><b>SOFA (Sub-Orbital Fighter Attack)</b></p>
<p>Sofas are similar to the old sofa but they use the new hit/damage point system. 
  A Sofa is used to batter down a planets fighters and torpedoes. The attack only 
  uses ship fighters to attack the planet. The calculations are the same as the 
  fighter phase for normal combat.</p>
<p>The planets torpedoes cannot attack you when you are making a Sofa run but 
  there is a slim chance the planet can lock on with their beams. If they do lock 
  on then you can take from 50% to 400% damage from the beams. If you are unlucky 
  enough to get tagged with 400% damage from the planet beams you will probably 
  be destroyed. The beam damage goes against your shields first and then your 
  armor. If you lose both armor and shields your ship is destroyed in the Sofa 
  run. </p>
