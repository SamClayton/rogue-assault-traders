                        focuses on building a planetary empire. First, upgrade 
                        your hull to level 15, then colonize a planet. Colonize 
                        the planets to 25 million colonists before moving on to 
                        the next planet. The reason for not fully colonizing a 
                        planet is that you want the colonists to procreate for 
                        as long as possible. Planets introduce population control 
                        at 100 million colonists, stopping any further growth 
                        (and potential overcrowding).<br>
                        <br>
                        Once you have a level 15 Hull, upgrade everything else 
                        (other than sensors and Armor) to level 10.<br>
                        <br>
                        Always have full Emergency Warp Devices and an Escape 
                        Pod. <br>
                        <br>
                        From then on, upgrade all technologies equally (again, 
                        other than sensors and armor). Upgrade as soon as you 
                        can.<br>
                        <br>
                        To colonize effectively, real space move to an upgrade 
                        port. Pick up a full load of Colonists, Fighters, and 
                        Torpedoes.<br>
                        <br>
                        Real space move to your new planet. Drop off Colonists, 
                        Fighters, Torpedoes, and the Energy you made from real space 
                        moving. On each new planet, set Energy production to 
                        20%, Organics to 15%, Goods to 10%, Ore to 10% 
                        and all other productions to zero. You'll need the energy 
                        to power planetary Shields and Beams, the organics to feed 
                        your colonists, ore and goods to create armor points.<br>
                        <br>
                        Colonize constantly, using the money produced by your 
                        Planets to buy supplies for your Planets. <br>
                        <br>
                        Colonization allows you to earn a lot of money in the 
                        long run, but it is rather slow to start. It also leaves 
                        your planets somewhat open to Conquerors.<br>&nbsp;
