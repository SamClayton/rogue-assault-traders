                         focuses on taking other players planets.<br>
                        <br>
                        Once captured, </span> you use the money from these new 
                        planets to upgrade even further. You end up with lots 
                        of ill gotten colonists and planets this way. They make 
                        money for you and you will quickly build an empire similar 
                        to what a Builder might be able to create.<br>
                        <br>
                        Be sure to stock every new planet acquired with plenty 
                        of Fighters and Torpedoes to be sure that the former owner 
                        won't come and try to take the planet back.
                        <p>The conqueror strategy (when effective) produces a 
                          large number of colonists in a very short period of 
                          time. However, you become hated quickly, and its very 
                          difficult to defend your new planets.<br>&nbsp;</p>
