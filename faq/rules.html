                        <span lang="en-us">To ensure fair game play for everyone, we have 
                        a few basic rules. </span> 
                        <p><span lang="en-us">You are not 
allowed to have multiple accounts. In other words, if you have more than one 
player in the game you are breaking the rules. If you
                          need two accounts to test a theory, host your own game. 
                          </span> </p>
                        <p><span lang="en-us">No inheritance 
exploits: When you're new you get&nbsp;a certain amount of&nbsp;turns. You can 
trade, leave the money somewhere safe, self destruct, and then sign on again 
with a new account and pick 
                          up the money. This is a two-fold rule violation. You are 
                          multi-playing AND abusing the system. Players doing so are 
                          obvious to everyone, as the efficiency rating will be impossibly high.&nbsp; You 
                          will probably be banned from the game and 
                          possibly added to the auto ban list so everytime 
                          the game is reset you are automatically banned.</span></p>
                        <p><span lang="en-us">Please refrain from cursing in player/character 
                          names, and other public portions of the game. <br>
                          <br>
                          If you have broken the rules, the administrator can 
                          take whatever action he chooses to deal with you. You 
                          have at that point violated the terms of use, and have 
                          no rights whatsoever. </span></p>
