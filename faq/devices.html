<strong>Space Beacons</strong> - Allows you to leave messages in sectors, some people use them to notate danger etc.<p>
<strong>Space Probes</strong> - There are 5 types of probes that can be purchased from the devices port. Once you have a probe and you drop it in a sector you can upgrade its sensors,cloak and engines. Information obtained by probes are put in your log files. 
<p>
You can change the probe type and give it orders: 
<br>
<ul><li><strong>Warp probe</strong> - will follow warp links and when it gets stuck will real space to a random sector. </li><p>

<li><strong>Real space probe</strong> - will real space to the target sector, if it can sneak past defences and then you will have to go pick it up. </li><p>

<li><strong>Real Space sequential</strong> - will real space to the target sector sequentially from your location to the target </li><p>

<li><strong>Stationary Probe</strong> - will detect and report to your logs once anyone enters your sector. They are also handy if you carry one around and your in a ship with lower sensors, you can use them to scan from the probe view menu </li><p>

<li><strong>Sentry Probes</strong> - Work exactly like stationary probes however with one twist. Once a sentry probe hits level 20 sensors it will report anyone entering your sector to your team shout box. </li><p></ul>

Note: Real Space Probes cost turns so be very careful if you send them out and they do not have high enough engines to real space somewhere. You may find it eating all your turns. 

<p>
<strong>Warp Editors</strong> - Allow you to create a warp link from one part of the galaxy to another or remove warp links.  But both require energy and credits to be able to create or remove.  This value is based on the distance in light years between the two sectors.  Closer sectors are cheaper and require much less energy.  <br>  A good strategy is to remove all the warp links you find to your base so you make it harder to find.  You can also create one way warps so you can scan into a sector yet the sector cannot scan back.<p>
<strong>Sector Genesis Torpedoes</strong> - Sector genesis works very similarly to regular genesis however they create a completely new sector in unknown space. They will randomly generate ports and stars for that sector. SG sectors have some limitations; you cannot realspace to or from them, or warp edit to and from them. You can create more SG sectors from within a SG sector however the limit is 2 links per sector. Once in an SG sector you can SG back to know space creating a SG Sector loop. The deeper you go, the more it will cost as the cost of building a tunnel doubles with each level you go back.
<p>
<strong>Genesis Torpedoes</strong> - Allows you to create planets in sectors where there are none.  It is also required should you want to destroy a planet.<p>
<strong>Mine Deflectors</strong> - As you enter sectors with mines, mine deflectors will deflect and destroy mines so they become a lifeline to your ship when players drop unknown mines in sectors. <p>
<strong>Emergency Warp Device</strong> - This is very handy if you are attacked.  Depending on the size of your ship when your attacked there is a chance that you will automatically warp away.  You can also manually use it to escape sectors where you get stuck behind sector defence or running away quickly from an enemy.  But you will never know where you will warp to.  It is a random place throughout the galaxy including SG's so it might be a good idea to keep more than one incase you get stuck a second time.<p>
<strong>Escape Pod</strong> - This is your lifeline in the game.  Forget an escape pod and your ship is destroyed, all your planets go independent your bank account is emptied and you are kicked out of the game for approx 3 days depending on settings.<p>
<strong>Fuel Scoop</strong> - This allows you to scoop energy as you real space from sector to sector.<p>
<strong>Mines/Fighters</strong> - This is how you deploy your sector defence.  You can only deploy what you currently cary on your ship.<p>

<strong>Nova Bomb</strong> - One of the most feared devices.  You can use them in two ways:
<p>
The first way is trying to destroy a planet. When fired you have a 15% chance it will destroy the planet AND ALL SHIPS DOCKED on the planet. If the ships have high enough engines they may escape the nova blast.  If the Nova Bomb doesn't destroy the planet it will damage everything on the planet up to 25%. This means everything, tech levels, credits, colonists, energy, fighters, torps, ect. There is also a 5% chance the Nova Bomb will explode on launch. If your ship has an average tech level below 15 it destroys the ship. If your ships average tech level is over 15 then your ship will be damaged between 50% and 75% on all tech levels, credits, energy, torps, fighter, ect. 
</p>
<p>
The second way if firing the Nova Bomb across a warp link. If you have a Nova Bomb on your ship your Long Rang Scan will add a Use Nova Bomb selection. When you fire the Nova Bomb across a warp link it will destroy 50%-100% of the sector defenses and then damage all planets and ships off planet 0%-5%. This means everything, tech levels, credits, colonists, energy, fighters, torps, ect. There is also a 5% chance the Nova Bomb will explode on launch. If your ship has an average tech level below 15 it destroys the ship. If your ships average tech level is over 15 then your ship will be damaged between 50% and 75% on all tech levels, credits, energy, torps, fighter, ect. This is a great way to clear out a sector that is defended so no ship can normally enter. </p>
