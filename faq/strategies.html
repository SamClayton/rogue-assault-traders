                        </font>Strategies are general gaming styles that can allow 
                        you to get an idea of how to play the game effectively. 
                        The best players generally use a combination of the strategies 
                        we list here. </span> 
                        <p><span lang="en-us">Strategies come and go. However, 
                          the four we offer have stood the test of time, and prove 
                          to be worthwhile. Please realize 
                          that no strategy can effectively guide a player through 
                          ALL of the game, just give guidelines and ideas that 
                          can be helpful.</span></p>

                          effective players can always be very helpful.</span><br>
