There are several type of ports in the game.  The primary trade ports are goods, ore, organics and energy ports.  As a trader these are your income source ports.

There are also several special ports in the game; upgrade, devices, spacedock and casino.
<p>
<b>Upgrade</b> - The upgrade port is your primary port to upgrade your ship.  You can also buy fighters, torpedos/mines, armor and colonist.  Colonists are used to build that planet you built.  Without them your planets produce nothing.
<p>
<b>Shipyards</b> - This is where you buy and store your ships. When taking a ship out of storage you will be charged a storage fee based on the amount of time that ship was stored and it will be moved to the shipyard you are currently in.
<p>
<b>Devices</b> - The device port is your primary port for purchasing items to re-enforce your ship and planet.  You can purchase escape pods, beacons, genesis devices, spies, ect.
<p>
<b>Spacedock</b> - This is your ships repair station.  Sometimes when you are attacking a planet or ship your armor is damaged.  Once your armor is damaged their is a chance that there will be tech level damage to your ship making it function at reduced tech levels.  The spacedock is the only place you can repair those levels.  The price is at a reduced cost though.
<p>
<b>Casino</b> - This is your diversion port.  A place where you can win or lose your hard earned credits.  Currently there is only a blackjack table and the smugglers den forum.  In the future the Casino port will have a more prominent role in how you play the game.
<p>
Note: Casino ports are located in an Kabal Zone.  Which means there is no protection while you play.  So be very careful when playing in the casino.

Also Kabal sectors will effect the prices of your upgrades so be sure your not sitting in a kabal zone when upgrading your ship.
