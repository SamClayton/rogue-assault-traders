<p>Alien Assault Traders is a multiplayer turn based space trading game.  Where players use turns that are accumilated over time to trade good and build empires and take over the universe.  </p>
                        <p> This game started out as a fork from the Nova Gaming 
                          System and Black Nova Traders. We saw great promise 
                          in the game but thought the direction being taken by 
                          the original authors was too limited.</p>
                        <p>So we sat down and came up with many ideas that would 
                          foster long term gameplay and allow great expansion 
                          of the game.</p>
						
                      
<p>
We have added many new features that great expand upon the game that everyone has welcomed with open and eager arms.
<p>
With the release of .20 the game has taken an evolutionary step and plays quite a bit different than its predesessors.  Please review the FAQ areas as we will try to put as much information about each feature as we can.
<p>
Please see the <a href="../docs/changelog.php">Changelog</a> for a complete set of changes.


                        <p>We have plans for many more additions and enhancements 
                          for the game and we are always open to suggestions.

						  <p>Some of the strategies in this guide are more than a little outdated for our game.
						  They are good as an initial guideline on how to play but don't take them as fact.
						  We will eventually have updated strategies for the game.
