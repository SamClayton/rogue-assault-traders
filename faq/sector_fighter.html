<p>Many of the things explained in Ship to Ship combat can be used in Ship to 
  Sector Fighter combat. The same damage calculations are used. The major difference 
  is that the tech level settings for the sector fighters are taken from the highest 
  tech level found on the planets in the sector (sensor, cloak, fighter bay and 
  torp levels). If you want to make your sector defenses more effective you need 
  to upgrade those four tech levels on your planets.</p>
<p>When you realspace or warp into a sector with enemy sector fighters you will 
  be asked what you would like to do...</p>
<p><b>Retreat</b></p>
<p>This will abort your move and take you back to the sector you started. The 
  only disadvantage is you will spend the turns to go both to the sector and back. 
  So if you were going to realspace to a sector with fighters and it would have 
  taken 15 turns then you would have spent 30 turns total retreating.</p>
<p><b>Attack</b></p>
<p>You jump into the sector and immediately attack all sector defenses. If you 
  have a higher ECM than the highest planet sensor then you will gain a higher 
  attack advantage. If the planets highest cloak is higher than your sensors then 
  the sector fighters will have a slight advantage.</p>
<p>The attack happens in five phases...</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Fighter to Fighter Phase</b></p>
  <p>Sector Fighters attack ship fighters.<br>
    Ship fighters attack Sector fighters.</p>
  <p><b>Fighter to torpedo/mine Phase</b>- If all fighters are destroyed then 
    nothing happens for that player in this phase.</p>
  <p>Sector Fighters attack ship torpedoes<br>
    Ship fighters attack Sector mines</p>
  <p><b>Ship Torp to Sector Fighter Phase </b>- If all ship torps are destroyed 
    then nothing happens in this phase.</p>
  <p>Ship torpedoes attack Sector fighters</p>
  <p><b>Sector Fighter to Ship Armor Phase</b> - If all Sector fighters are destroyed 
    then nothing happens in this phase.</p>
  <p>Sector Fighters attack ship armor</p>
  <p><b>Resolution</b></p>
  <p>If the ship loses all armor it is destroyed. If it doesn't then it enters 
    the sector even if there are remaining sector fighters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Attack and Run</b></p>
<p>Attack and Run allows a player to whittle down overwhelming sector defense 
  fighters by making lightening raids on the sector. The player realspace or warps 
  in and out as fast as they can. During that time they drop off all fighters 
  and torpedoes they are carrying. The same combat is followed as a normal Attack 
  listed above. The difference is you are running out of sector at high speed. 
  If your engines are higher than the highest Fighter Bay tech of the planets 
  in the sector you might escape with very little damage, if any.</p>
<p>If the sector fighters do catch up to your ship as you are leaving you can 
  take from a fraction of the normal damage of all fighters in the sector (as 
  low as 0.01%) to as much as enough to destroy your ship (200% to 300%). So it 
  it a good idea to have very high engines, ecm and cloak on your ship if you 
  plan on doing attack and runs.</p>
<p>You will eventually whittle down the number of fighters in the sector to a 
  point where futher attack and runs are useless. You will then have to use a 
  normal attack. If you you normally get a bounty when attacking any of the planets 
  in the sector then the attack and run will not work. You will have to use a 
  normal attack.</p>
<p><b>Cloak</b></p>
<p>You can try to sneak into a sector if your cloak is high enough. If the highest 
  sensor tech on the planets in the sector detects your ship then you will have 
  to go through the normal Attack listed above. So be careful.</p>
